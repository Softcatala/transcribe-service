# Running the system locally using Docker

This requires that you have *docker*, *docker-compose* and *make* installed in your system.

First build by running:

```shell
 make build-all
```

Once the system is built, you can run it typing:

```shell
docker-run
```

And open http://localhost:8700/hello to test the service
